<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span> 
<p class="hamlet">To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br>
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;<br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause: there's the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life;<br>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br>
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br>
The insolence of office and the spurns<br>
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
When he himself might his quietus make<br>
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
But that the dread of something after death,<br>
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn<br>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br>
With this regard their currents turn awry,<br>
And lose the name of action.â€”Soft you now!<br>
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons<br>
Be all my sins remember'd.</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA</span><br> 
<p class="ophelia">Good my lord,<br> 
How does your honour for this many a day?</p> 

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span> 
<p class="hamlet">I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA</span>  <br>
<p class="ophelia">My lord, I have remembrances of yours,<br>
That I have longed long to re-deliver;<br>
I pray you, now receive them.</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span><br>
<p class="hamlet">No, not I;<br>
I never gave you aught.</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA </span> <br>
<p class="ophelia">My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;<br>
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed<br>
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,<br>
Take these again; for to the noble mind<br>
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.<br>
There, my lord.</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span> <br>
<p class="hamlet">Ha, ha! are you honest?</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA</span> <br>
<p class="ophelia">My lord?</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span> <br>
<p class="hamlet">Are you fair?</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA</span> <br>
<p class="ophelia">What means your lordship?</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span> <br>
<p class="hamlet">That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should<br>
admit no discourse to your beauty.</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA </span> <br>
<p class="ophelia">Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than<br>
with honesty?</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span> <br>
<p class="hamlet">Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner<br>
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the<br>
force of honesty can translate beauty into his<br>
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the<br>
time gives it proof. I did love you once.</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA </span> <br>
<p class="ophelia">Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span> <br>
<p class="hamlet">You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot<br>
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of<br>
it: I loved you not.</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA</span>  <br>
<p class="ophelia">I was the more deceived.</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span>  <br>
<p class="hamlet">Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a<br>
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;<br>
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it<br>
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very<br>
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at<br>
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,<br>
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them<br>
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling<br>
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,<br>
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.<br>
Where's your father?</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA</span>  <br>
<p class="ophelia">At home, my lord.</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span>  <br>
<p class="hamlet">Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the<br>
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA </span> <br>
<p class="ophelia">O, help him, you sweet heavens!</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET</span>  <br>
<p class="hamlet">If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for<br>
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as<br>
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a<br>
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs<br>
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough<br>
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,<br>
and quickly too. Farewell.</p>

<span class="ophelia-name">OPHELIA </span> <br>
<p class="ophelia">O heavenly powers, restore him!</p>

<span class="hamlet-name">HAMLET </span> <br>
<p class="hamlet">I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God<br>
has given you one face, and you make yourselves<br>
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and<br>
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness<br>
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath<br>
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:<br>
those that are married already, all but one, shall<br>
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a<br>
nunnery, go.</p>

<p class="ophelia">O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!<br>
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;<br>
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,<br>
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,<br>
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!<br>
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,<br>
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,<br>
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,<br>
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;<br>
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth<br>
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,<br>
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!</p>
