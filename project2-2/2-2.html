<p>made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: 
<div class="nav">
<a href="2-1.html" class="prev"><</a>
<a href="blank2-2.html" class="blank">x</a>
<a href="2-3.html" class="next">></a>
</div>
</p>
</body>
